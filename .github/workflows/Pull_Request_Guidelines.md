# Pull Request Guidelines

## Objective
Every Pull Request must have a clearly defined objective. Ensure that your changes address a specific issue, add new functionality, or enhance existing code.

## Branching
Create a new branch for each Pull Request. The branch name should reflect the nature of the changes, such as "feature/new-feature" or "bugfix/bug-fix".

## Relevance
Ensure that your branch is up to date with the base branch (usually `main` or `master`). Update your branch before creating a Pull Request.

## Code Readability
Code should be readable and maintainable. Adhere to code formatting conventions, use clear variable and function names, and add comments where necessary.

## Testing
Always provide tests for your changes and ensure they pass successfully. If any changes require updates to existing tests, modify them accordingly.

## Pull Request Description
Provide a detailed description of what your Pull Request accomplishes. Include links to related issues and any noteworthy considerations.

## Code Review
Expect code reviews from other team members. Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments as requested.

## Responding to Comments
Respond to comments promptly and make necessary adjustments based on feedback.
